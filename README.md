# SQL Clone

Here's the repo for a side project I did earlier this year.

I love backend work, and I've taken a keen interest into databases, so I figured I'd try building my own.

Really, It's an SQLite clone. It's not perfect, and some kinks still need to be worked out, but overall it works and it was fun to do :)
